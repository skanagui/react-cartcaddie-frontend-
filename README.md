# Course Caddie App


As a NYC  resident and avid golfer,  I know how important time and money is. The idea to create this app was to fulfill 3 needs for the metropolitan area golfer and golf courses. 

These needs were to: 

1. Streamline the process in which golfers are set out onto the course to save time.  
2. To increase revenues for golf course businesses by creating an online store. 
3. To create a contactless Pro-Shop to insure the health of employees during these trying times.
